* Thank everyone for coming here.
* Introduce CISO Global
	* Let a person speak about its history quickly?
* Ask how many of them are Cat people vs Dog people?
* Phase 1 starts the learning process for the ASPCA - April 17th
	* Help Desk and the Operations team will work hand in hand to help build knowledgebase for us to use and share with CISO
* Phase 2 starts a more streamlined approach.
	* We will keep Ciso-Review, but Help Desk Managers - can and will forward off requests to CISO based on our knowledgebase
