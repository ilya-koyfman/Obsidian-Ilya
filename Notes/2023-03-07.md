###### Email about Azure Pricing
#azure 
```
Hi Luke, I want to schedule a few internal calls between the people on the email to discuss, plan, and agree upon our Azure resource pricing planning.

The whole purpose is to take the knowledge we have learned about cost saving in Azure have everyone agree on the pricing, and then I will make the changes. I will also document this for next time.

I will write up as much as I can before the meetings as well.
