# Important Tasks
- [ ] Ilya going to make Pulse VPN Profiles #MSP 
# Other Tasks


We are giving access to our Pulse VPN appliance to CISO Global. This means ASPCA will create AD users, which will then create okta accounts, that will be assigned our pulse appliance and force users to go through MFA auth.

| Site | Subnet          |        IP        |
| ---- | --------------- |:----------------:|
| 92nd | 10.1.151.1.0/24 | 10.1.151.4:10443 |
| 8th  | 10.1.100.0/24   | 10.1.100.4:10443 |
| WDC  | 10.1.88.0/24    | 10.1.88                 |

#### User Creation
1. Ilya will create users
	EX: ed.see@cerberussentinel.com would be created as ed.see@aspca.org with a strong password and can't change password
2. Send over User/Pass Info to team over encrypted email
3. Users go to https://aspca.okta.com login and set up MFA on a CISO Global device. We use Okta Verify, but others work I believe.
4. Users will also set up a VPN application on their work machine.
5. Once set up they can setup to use the same credentials to log into the VPN
