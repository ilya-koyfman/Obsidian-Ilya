The Great ASPCA Migration

Good morning all,

Today I am going to be migrating computers into the Cerberus Datto platform starting at 10 am with these 4 sites first
* Bronx Hub/Bronx CVC
* Glendale
* WDC
* OH - Marysville 

As I see machines come into the new platform, I will give it till 1pm when I start running the next larger sites.
* ASNA
* BRC
* LA

The jobs I am setting on these sites run every hour, until the end of the month. All the machines need to do would be online to grab the job.

P.S. If you haven't tried signing into Cerberus Datto or missed the invite please send me an email.

Thank you all for helping get to this point!
