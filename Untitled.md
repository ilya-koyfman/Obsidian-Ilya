# Documentation for LucidChart

## Lucid at the ASPCA
Lucid is software that we at the ASPCA use technical diagrams and flowcharts. The structure of the space is separated into **Team Folders**. Currently there are two Team's; Information Technology and Membership.

### Structure of Information Technology
The root of the IT folder should not contain any items. All the second level folders are setup as the separate IT teams. Each team, will have two folders included initially for flows and for technical Diagrams. Each team would be responsible for documents in their space.

###### Suggestions
* Try to keep Lucid Spark Documents in Flows, try to keep any tech diagrams in Technical Diagrams.

#### Document Process
Organized documents are key for maintaining good data quality. Due to wanting to keep better data, a few rules will be imposed on document creation that will be used to accomplish this.
* On Document Creation, you will be asked to fill out these Attributes
